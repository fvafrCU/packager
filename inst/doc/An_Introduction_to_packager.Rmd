# Teaser
Helper functions for a build system, heavily borrowing from and extending package `devtools 1.13.3`. 

# Features
I find devtools very helpful but it lacks some functionality I would want while creating and building a package.
 Maybe \pkg{packager} should be two packages. 

# A Minimal Example
