Dear CRAN Team,
this is a resubmission of package 'packager'. I have added the following changes:

* Added function get\_gitlab\_info() and added it to provide\_cran\_comments().
* Added functions to dput and evaluate objects via log file.
* Added function get\_gitlab\_log() to read a check log from gitlab.

Please upload to CRAN.
Best, Andreas Dominik
