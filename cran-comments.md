Dear CRAN Team,
this is a resubmission of package 'packager'. I have added the following changes:

* Sanitized the return value of git\_sync\_status().
* Linted the codes heavily.
* Added an inclusion pattern to check\_codetags() and set reasonable defaults
  for patterns.

Please upload to CRAN.
Best, Andreas Dominik
