Dear CRAN Team,
this is a resubmission of package 'packager'. I have added the following changes:

* Added check\_cyclomatic\_complexity() to check for cyclometric complexity.
* Added add\_github\_url\_to\_desc() to add the package's github URL to the package's
  DESCRIPTION file.

Please upload to CRAN.
Best, Dominik
