Dear CRAN Team,
this is a resubmission of package 'packager'. I have added the following changes:

- Fixed testing.
- Added internal function strip\_off\_attributes(), mainly to get rid of object 
names.
- Fixed querying the package's maintainer's name.
- Updated package's info.


Please upload to CRAN.
Best, Andreas Dominik
